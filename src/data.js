Instead of having surgery, Kolu opted for a rehabilitation program and turned to Sweatbox APG. Our head Coach Getachew and Coach Kidus were able to help Kolu regain his strength and transform his body. Most importantly Kolu is now pain-free and able to return to the sport he loves. For most people, the setback of an injury is not just physical but also mental and emotional. Recovery takes time and hard work and you need to overcome the fear of repeat injuries or aggravation when returning to exercise after a sports injury.

No pills, no supplements, just hard work and consistency. But more importantly, it was not only the physical aspect of weight loss that challenged her, it was the mental aspect as well.

      "Muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein breakdown are natural processes within the body. To boost muscle protein synthesis, focus on two key strategies. First, follow expert-designed workouts, which signal the body to synthesize muscle protein. Secondly, prioritize protein-rich foods, especially those high in Leucine. However, for sustained muscle growth, ensure a balanced intake of various amino acids and nutrients. When Thomas joined Sweatbox, his goal was weight loss. However, following discussions with Coach Tadelo, his objective shifted towards body recomposition. As a result, he has simultaneously gained muscle mass and lost body fat. Due to the inherent density of muscle tissue, Thomas has gained 8 kgs, reflecting the success of his body recomposition journey.",
